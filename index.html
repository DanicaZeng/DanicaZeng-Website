        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-Businessüìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Danica Zeng, a freshman at the University of Califonia, Riverside. My major is pre-business, which will later transfer into the school of Business, concentrating in Marketing. I do not have much experience about marketing nor business. The reason why I chose this major is that I think it is easier to find a job after I graduated. My work experience mostly came from last summer, when I got my first job at a Boba shop. I learned how to deal with money, and deal with promotion in order to keep more customers coming to buy Boba. My dream job is to get a career that works in a makeup company for their marketing department. My first quarter at UCR was great. I got an A in the course ‚ÄúIntroduction to Business.‚Äù I also earned an A-minus in Calculus 9B. I think this math class is easier than the calculus class I took in high school. In the winter quarter, I took Econ 003, Phys 002, English 004, and CS 008. I was glad that I got all these courses so that I can learn a lot of knowledge within three months. 
	During my free time, I like to go to the gym. So I can exercise regularly, and lose the fat I want. Besides going to the gym, I also like to watch YouTube. I also have my own YouTube channel. It records every new place or new experience I had been through. Although I do not have many subscribers, my channel main purpose is to record down every wonderful moment I spend with my friends. 
	I also like to use makeup to change my look. People often said that I look totally different with makeup on. I also like to watch different tutorial videos about how to make desserts. I love to eat desserts very much. I often explore new restaurants to taste their new foods. One of my hobbies is to go to different boba shop and try their drinks to see the differences from each other. Therefore, exercise is definitely needed since I want to have a healthy body. I also like to travel to different places to explore new cultures and food. My next dream place to visit is the countries in Europe.
	I came from a Chinese family; I came to the United States when I was in fifth grade. I do not feel much of a culture gap since I came to the US at a young age. At home, I speak Cantonese to my parents. I also know how to speak Mandarin since I learn it from my elementary school back in China. I was glad that I could speak multiple languages, so I can communicate with more people using different languages. I also plan to learn Spanish, so it can increase my hiring rates later in life. I can also make more friends by speaking about different types of languages. 
	The paragraphs above are my personal introduction, thank you for reading through everything.
